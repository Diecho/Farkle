For this project you will implement Farkle with a partner. I recommend splitting up the responsibilities between you and your partner, but each person is individually responsible for the WHOLE PROJECT.

You will get one letter grade for each of these bullet points you implement:

1) You must have a separate .h file for each of your classes. The .h files must contain only declarations, not definitions. If you have any function definitions in your .h files you will lose this letter grade. You must have a separate .cc file for each of your classes. The .cc files must contain the implementation details for the given class. You must write a Makefile that will properly build your project.

2) You must do all of your work on Github, using branches (these directions are for the project lead):
A) Create a blank Github repo using the C++ template (this will set up the gitignore correctly)
B) Clone it to a local directory here
C) Copy the farkle files in to that directory
D) Push the changes out to Github (you will need to make a PAT and cache
credentials the first time you do this)
E) Invite your collaborators and invite me (william.kerney@scccd.edu)
F) Each collaborator must make a branch using "git checkout -b BranchNameHere"
(replace BranchNameHere with the name of your branch, like your name)
G) Each person should "git pull" occasionally to synch up their code
H) Each person works on their features, and when their changes are working and
ready do a "git push" when it's feature complete.
I) Switch to the website and you will see a button to merge your changes and
walk through any merge conflicts using the web site
J) Once it is merged, make a new branch and work on a new feature until it is
done.

3) You must implement these classes at a minimum: die (represents a single
die), player (holds their score, dialogue, money, etc.), table (which holds
the six dice, the wager up for winning, and the score for the current turn).
You may implement an AI that plays Farkle for extra credit.

4) You must implement the rules of Farkle, as implemented in Kingdom Come:
Deliverance.  The rules can be found here:
https://kingdom-come-deliverance.fandom.com/wiki/Dice.  (Note that recent
patches added a couple more ways of scoring, which you can choose to implement
for extra credit.) Basically you roll six dice and can choose to keep some of
the dice and score them and then reroll. If you ever make a roll and there are
no points available, you "bust" and lose all the points you have accumulated
for the current turn. A 1 scores 100 points, a 5 scores 50 points, and three
of a kind scores the die value * 100 (except three 1s which scores 1000). Four
of a kind doubles that value, so four 4s scores 800. Five of a kind doubles it
again, six of a kind doubles it again. You can choose to not reroll and keep
your score, which adds it to the scoreboard. Then the other person goes.

5) You must implement a weighted dice system, and allow the user to select
which dice he/she will use when playing Farkle. A fair die has equal odds for
each of the six faces, but a weighted die might have the following odds: 1
(40%), 2 (10%), 3 (10%), 4 (10%), 5 (20%),  6 (10%). This would be quite a
good die as 1s are valuable in Farkle. ./dice_database.txt contains the
weights for some of the dice in KCD1.

Extra credit will be available for going above and beyond the minimum
requirements. I gave you some suggestions above. You can earn up to two letter
grades of extra credit by doing things like a TUI or a GUI, adding music and
sound, that sort of thing.

Report on Canvas which of the above bullet points you did.
